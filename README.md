`linefeed` is a configurable, concurrent, extensible, interactive input reader
for Unix terminals and Windows console.

## This is a linefeed fork

cicada shell relies on linefeed a lot. As murarth got [no time](https://github.com/murarth/linefeed/issues/72)
on new updates, I forked it here to make changes for supporting for command
line highlighting etc.
